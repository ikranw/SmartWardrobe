# Smart Wardrobe

## Project Overview
Inspired by the 2000's movie Clueless, our Smart Wardrobe helps users visualise their closet and pick outfits in a faster efficient way by taking weather and previously owned outfits into consideration. 

### Key Features
- Outfit planner
- Select + Laundry
- Pre-saved outfits for quicker retreival
- Up-to-date weather data

## Design Process

### Research / Interviewing
We started with a few external interviews to gather information on what users may want in a smart wardrobe

#### Questions Asked
- Can you walk me through how you usually decide what to wear each day? In what order?
- How do you organize your clothes right now? (e.g., by color, type, season, occasion)
- How much control would you wantâ€”would you prefer it to recommend outfits based on factors like weather, or would you want full control?
- How do you keep track of what's in your wardrobe right now?

#### Findings
- Most people check weather first, then consider their daily schedule/activities
- Common pain point: forgetting about clothes they own, leading to leaving loved pieces in the back
- Organization varies widely (by type, by color, by formality)
- Everyone liked having say over their outfit choice
- People want to avoid repeating outfits too frequently, especially for work/school
- Clean v dirty clothing status is tracked mentally/visually but imperfectly
- Morning routine needs to be quick (under 5 minutes for outfit selection unless for special event)

### Affordances / User Needs
#### Physical Characteristics:
- Large, fixed furniture piece
- Requires space in front for doors to open and user to stand
#### Affordances:
- Doors with handles afford opening to access clothing
- Touchscreen display affords tapping and swiping
- Interior rods and shelves afford hanging and storing clothes
- Screen placement affords viewing while standing


#### User Needs
User Need: Browse wardrobe manually when feeling creative

Design Requirement: Browse mode with filters for season, type, occasion, color


User Need: Track which clothes are clean vs. dirty

Design Requirement: "In laundry" toggle for items; "Laundry done" button to mark all items as available again


User Need: See complete outfits, not just individual pieces

Design Requirement: Display top + bottom together; option to swap out individual pieces


User Need: Save favorite outfit combinations

Design Requirement: "Save preset" button to store and quickly access favorite outfits

#### User Feedback

Mock website Feeback
- Have a notifcation to notify users that clothes are back in the closet after laundry
- It would be nice to have some pre-saved outfits that I can pick and wear instead of scrolling through the options. 
- Make Testing UI buttons bigger and make the interface more usable
- Distinguish closet from saved outfits so its neater and more seperated.

When the user selects an outfit, it is removed from the wardrobe and moved over to the laundry feature

When you're done with laundry, you'll click the laundry button and the outfits will be returned to the wardrobe
