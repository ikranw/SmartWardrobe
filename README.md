## Design Process

### Research / Interviewing
We started with a few external interviews to gather information on what users may want in a smart wardrobe

#### Questions Asked
- Can you walk me through how you usually decide what to wear each day? In what order?
- How do you organize your clothes right now? (e.g., by color, type, season, occasion)
- How much control would you wantâ€”would you prefer it to recommend outfits based on factors like weather, or would you want full control?
- How do you keep track of what's in your wardrobe right now?

#### Findings
- Most people check weather first, then consider their daily schedule/activities
- Common pain point: forgetting about clothes they own, leading to leaving loved pieces in the back
- Organization varies widely (by type, by color, by formality)
- Everyone liked having say over their outfit choice
- People want to avoid repeating outfits too frequently, especially for work/school
- Clean v dirty clothing status is tracked mentally/visually but imperfectly
- Morning routine needs to be quick (under 5 minutes for outfit selection unless for special event)

### Affordances / User Needs
#### Physical Characteristics:
- Large, fixed furniture piece
- Requires space in front for doors to open and user to stand
#### Affordances:
- Doors with handles afford opening to access clothing
- Touchscreen display affords tapping and swiping
- Interior rods and shelves afford hanging and storing clothes
- Screen placement affords viewing while standing
